2. **Aggregation Server** (`server.py`)
   - Client management and registration
   - Model update processing
   - Adaptive client selection
   - Convergence monitoring
   - Background task management

3. **Authentication System** (`auth.py`)
   - JWT token generation and verification
   - Client credential management
   - Role-based access control
   - Token lifecycle management

4. **Model Storage** (`storage.py`)
   - Versioned model storage
   - Metadata management
   - Checkpoint creation and restoration
   - Storage statistics and cleanup

5. **Advanced Aggregation** (`aggregation.py`)
   - FedAvg (Federated Averaging)
   - Krum (Byzantine-fault-tolerant)
   - Trimmed Mean (Byzantine-fault-tolerant)
   - Weighted aggregation
   - Pluggable aggregation factory

6. **Privacy & Security** (`privacy.py`)
   - Differential privacy mechanisms
